IDN contributed use cases for GHAP HASS-I integration activity

## Use Case: reference historical placenames from HCCDA

GHAP currently includes 2 types of layers based on historical census (ADA's HCCDA) - one for just placenames, the other for data, such as populations.
As historical demographers, we want to see all official administrative names, as at the census date, recorded in GHAP, for all the Australian historical censuses, as a reference dataset.  

In addition, the tables from which these two layers are derived contain a wealth of other information about the named localities. That information should also be included in the GHAP, not only for the light it sheds on the social, economic, climatic and other characteristics associated with the locality at the time, but also to facilitate examination of changes over time reflected in the series of censuses.

This will integrate both with the IIRC project, since some of the historical censuses containg information about Aboriginal people in named localities, but also with IRISS, which will be attempting to document changes over time in the boundaries associated with the names.

Many of the HCCDA volumes include maps which show boundaries of counties, electorates, local government areas, land divisions etc. NLA has a program for digitising these historical maps. The digitised images provide the basis for digitised boundaries, which could be linked to the placenames in GHAP.
