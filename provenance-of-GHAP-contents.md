# Provenance and data quality related use cases

IN PROGRESS....

As a historical data analyst interested in historical censuses, I want to be able to discover what is contained in GHAP, it's data quality, and whether it is useful to me. For example, with historical census related content, I want to be able to list all layers for one or more State jurisdictions to see what temporal coverage is given.

what layers are available in a particular known jurisdiction e.g. a state or an LGA AND for a particular TIME period
e.g. 1921-1940 indigenous censuses taken by different states -- are these already present or not in HGAP. 

As a potential user, I want to understand how layers relate to each other, so I can assess what is available there and whether it can be used in applications I am interested in.

As a user of HCCDA (Historical censuses), I want to discover how much coverage there is in the GHAP of the jurisdiction names across each census (State and Year), so I can know whether I need to request that the HCCDA needs to be loaded.


I want to be able to identify a geospatial entity (e.g. area) as it was at a specific point in time, and to select it as a specific "geography" or a "place"
I then want to be able to see what "features" (layers? facts?) are asserted which relate to that "place".
I want to be able to filter those results across time.


OR is the ONLY relation across layers involve being in the same geospatial place/coordinates OR/AND sharing a name?


Initial CONTENT of GHAP (one off data load): 2012 Official Gazette, HCCDA, Police districts as per Indigenous censuses (all the OFFICIAL sources + dates applicable)... 
IFF that was done, along with maps from the censuses, THEN its possible to visualise both boundary changes.


Want to see changing no of aborigines across time -- so need to "merge" in indigenous census data into HCCDA.
Requires a systematic load of HCCDA supplemented with police districts used in Indigenous censuses 1921-1944.
All the HCCDA censuses had MAPSwith multiple divisions e.g. counties, electorates, land divisions,
local govt areas, sometimes police districts (and others)
Data in the tables (available in xhtml) were repeated across these divisions.
There is a project in the NLA to digitise historical maps -- perhaps they could do the census maps.
